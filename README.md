# pythoncurrencychecker
A project made for fun

IMPORTANT

I have included a command file for windows that will automatically run the script. If you do not use the command file the Python script will run and exit almost straight away. 

YOU MUST

Have the latest version of Python installed and change the directory of the script to wherever you have saved it.
i.e. change "cd Desktop cd SchoolProjects" to the appropriate working directory.
